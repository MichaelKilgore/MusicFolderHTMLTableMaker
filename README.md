Relevant Instructions: Run the awk solution by typing "./awkSolution Music/". run the perl solution by typing "./perlSolution Music/". Both of these will create the same file called "AudioFiles.html". If you run the program once, you have to delete AudioFiles.html before running again or the file won't build correctly.

compare @ contrast: The perl solution was more elegant in some ways, but I encountered alot more problems with perl than when I was working with awk.

 Run program by typing ./script.sh and then the path to the Music folder aka "./script.sh Music/"
