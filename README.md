# MusicFolderHTMLTableMaker

Synopsis:\
This project takes the given Music folder and uses it to create an html file. The html file when opened displays a table of all the music in the Music folder. This project has both an awk solution and a perl solution, both create the same file.

Usage:
To use this program run the perl solution by typing "./perlSolution Music/". To run the awk solution type "./awkSolution Music/". Both of these executions will create the same file called "AudioFiles.html". If you run the program once, you have to delete AudioFiles.html before running again or the file won't build correctly.
i.e. "./script.sh Music/" Then the program will ask to enter either 1 or 2.

Limitations:
The awk solution does not build correctly, but the perl solution builds perfectly.
